Ivy Wallet is a free budget manager and spending tracker app that’ll help you manage your personal finances with ease.

Imagine Ivy Wallet as a digital financial notebook (manual expense tracker) in which you’ll track your income, expenses, and budget.

The advantage that our money manager gives you is that you can track expenses on the go with an intuitive and simple user interface (UI).

Once your transactions make their way into Ivy Wallet, the spending tracker app will give you insight into your monthly spending and help you plan your budgets.

When you enter more income and expenses in the money manager app you'll have an answer to three essential questions:

1) Exactly how much money do I have right now in all accounts combined? (money manager)

2) How much did I spend this month and where? (expense tracker)

3) How much money can I spend and still reach my financial goals? (budget manager)

$Track. $Budget. $Save
